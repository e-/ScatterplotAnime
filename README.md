# ScatterplotAnime

> This repository demonstrates the performance of 5 scatterplot animation methods on web browsers.

## Usage

Just visit [this link](http://e-.github.io/ScatterplotAnime/). Enter the number of points you want to test and press the Play button. I recommend using Google Chrome.

## Why?

I was wondering how many points can be animated at once on web browsers. So, I implemented 5 animation methods with various technologies (SVG, Canvas, and WebGL). As you can see, using WebGL is the most efficient method for scatterplot animation although it requires tricky implementation.

## Methods

I made three requirements that all methods should implement:

1. When initialized, each method should show `N` points with randomly-chosen position and color (selected from [`d3.scale.category10`](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales#categorical-colors)).
2. Each method should animate the points smoothly to randomly-chosen destination points in 1 second.
3. The animation should involve at least one easing function. I used [the cubic-in-out easing function](http://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic) which is the default easing function in d3.js.

Each method is implemented separately in a single javascript file. 

1. webgl.js: This method uses WebGL. 
2. pixeldata.js: This method manipulates the pixel data of a canvas element. For simplicity, it draws a small rectangle instead of a circle. 
3. svg.js: This method uses d3's `transition`.
4. canvas.js: This method is very similar to the baseline method except that it uses [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) for better performance.
5. baseline.js: Naive implementation. It draws points on a `canvas` element and animates them using `setInterval`.

If you have other animation methods, please feel free to add them. Please make sure that your method implements the three requirements above.
